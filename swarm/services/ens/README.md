# Swarm ENS interface

The ABI and BIN files in contract subdirectory implement simple registrar and personal resolver contracts; they're used in tests, and can be used to deploy these contracts for your own purposes.

The solidity source code can be found at [github.com/arachnid/ens/](https://github.com/arachnid/ens/).

The ABI and BIN files in the contract subdirectory were generated by

```shell
solc -o `pwd` --optimise --abi --bin OpenRegistrar.sol
solc -o `pwd` --optimise --abi --bin PersonalResolver.sol
```

using the .sol files in [revision 8b38b23a23100d5c325ae3fa24935f5ab93d61ba](https://github.com/Arachnid/ens/commit/8b38b23a23100d5c325ae3fa24935f5ab93d61ba)
with solc version 0.3.5-0/RelWithDebInfo-Linux/g++/Interpreter

The go bindings for ENS contracts are generated using `abigen` via the go generator:

```shell
godep go generate ./swarm/services/ens
```
