	persistentQueue represents a queue stored in a state store
	Items are enqueued by writing them to the state store with the timestamp as prefix and a nonce so that two items can be queued at the same time
	It provides a (blocking) Next function to wait for a new item to be available. Only a single call to Next may be active at any time
	To allow atomic operations with other state store operations all functions only write to batches instead of writing to the store directly
	The user must ensure that all functions (except Next) are called with the same lock held which is provided externally so multiple queues can use the same
	The queue provides no dequeue function. Instead an item must be deleted by its key
